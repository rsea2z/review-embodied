## 💡 Writing Principles

1. **Contrastive Definitions**: Axes should contrast clearly (binary or enumerated)
2. **Chronological Organization**: Within categories, organize from early to recent work
3. **Scope Clarity**: Explicitly state what you include and exclude
4. **Framework Cohesion**: Every section connects back to central taxonomy
5. **Reproducibility**: Provide datasets, metrics, and resources for readers
6. **Balanced Critique**: Acknowledge gaps in prior work constructively
7. **Metric Justification**: Explain why each metric matters
8. **Visual Organization**: Use tables to summarize, text to explain

## ✅ Quality Checklist

A survey is comprehensive when it includes:
- [ ] Clear, contrastive taxonomy (2-4 axes)
- [ ] Comprehensive literature tables (organized by taxonomy)
- [ ] Systematic data resources (4 categories: sim, benchmark, offline, real)
- [ ] Complete metrics taxonomy (visual, state-level, physics, long-horizon, domain-specific)
- [ ] Quantitative comparisons (tables, graphs, trade-off analysis)
- [ ] Open challenges synthesis (3+ challenges with problem/solution/gaps)
- [ ] Emerging trends identification (2-3 trends with open questions)
- [ ] Mathematical foundations (formalism, equations, architecture connection)
- [ ] Reproducibility resources (datasets, code, benchmarks)

## 🔍 Common Questions

**Q: How many taxonomy axes should I have?**
A: 2-4 axes. Fewer than 2 oversimplifies; more than 4 creates confusion.

**Q: Should all papers fit neatly into taxonomy cells?**
A: Aim for >80% clear classification. Use footnotes for edge cases.

**Q: How comprehensive should the literature review be?**
A: Provide comprehensive table (Table I/II) showing all major papers in your taxonomy.

**Q: What if I find a paper that doesn't fit?**
A: Either (1) refine your taxonomy to include it, or (2) explicitly exclude it with justification.

**Q: How long should each section be?**
A: Introduction 2-3 pages, Background 1-2 pages, Taxonomy 4-8 pages, Data/Metrics 2-3 pages, Challenges 1-2 pages.
