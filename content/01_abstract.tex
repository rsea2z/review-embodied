Embodied intelligence requires agents to perceive multimodal environments, execute goal-directed actions under physical constraints, and anticipate how those actions reshape future world states---capabilities central to both robotic manipulation and autonomous driving. Over the past two years, the field has undergone a decisive transition: modular perception-planning-control pipelines are giving way to large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) policies and world-model-based control stacks that jointly optimize representation, prediction, and decision making \citep{liang_large_2025,liu_aligning_2025,li_comprehensive_2025,fung_embodied_2025,ding_understanding_2025,zhong_survey_2025,yu_survey_2026}. This survey presents a unified framework covering \textbf{318 papers} from January 2024 to February 2026. We formalize the embodied control problem as a partially observable Markov decision process and derive a shared learning objective that couples latent dynamics modeling with downstream control optimization. We propose a \textbf{three-axis taxonomy}: (1)~\emph{Functionality}---decision-coupled models that directly optimize task-facing objectives versus general-purpose models trained for broad predictive transfer \citep{nvidia_cosmos_2025,team_gigaworld-0_2025,team_gigabrain-0_2025}; (2)~\emph{Temporal Modeling}---sequential step-by-step rollouts versus global trajectory-segment predictors \citep{wan_worldagen_2025,mei_video_2026,wang_mechanistic_2026}; (3)~\emph{Spatial Representation}---compact latent vectors, tokenized feature sequences, and geometry-aware rendering representations \citep{sun_geovla_2025,zhang_4d-vla_2025,chen_bridgev2w_2026,qu_spatialvla_2025}. We systematize data resources and evaluation metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and embodied simulation, covering five metric families---task success, control stability, prediction fidelity, generalization, and compute efficiency---and compare more than 30 representative systems across four method families: foundation VLA policies \citep{kim_openvla_2024,black__0_2026,intelligence__05_2025,nvidia_gr00t_2025}, world-model-guided control \citep{cen_worldvla_2025,chen_bridgev2w_2026}, post-training reinforcement refinement \citep{intelligence__06_2025,li_vla-rft_2025,lu_vla-rl_2025,chen_conrft_2025}, and efficiency-oriented adaptation \citep{pertsch_fast_2025,yang_efficientvla_2025,shen_efficient_2026}. The analysis distills six open challenges: long-horizon physical consistency, embodiment-aware representation alignment, deployment-oriented evaluation, compute governance, safe continual adaptation, and multi-agent coordination.
