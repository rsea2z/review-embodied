\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This survey synthesized embodied AI and world-model research from 2024 to early 2026 under a coupled framework that links system-level embodied decision stacks with model-level dynamics design choices. The central conclusion is that strong embodied performance now depends on explicit coordination among representation, prediction, and control, rather than progress in any single module.

Beyond conceptual synthesis, we provide an auditable citation workflow over 318 collected papers, including in-scope grouping and explicit exclusion logs. This structure is intended to make future updates incremental and reproducible as the field continues to evolve rapidly.
